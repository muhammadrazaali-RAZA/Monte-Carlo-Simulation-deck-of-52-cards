# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-deck-of-52-cards
Probability of out comes and simulation feel like physically

a)	the probability that at least two queens will appear next to each other in the shuffled deck.
b)	the probability that at least one king and one queen appear next to each other or one card away in the shuffled deck. (Bonus marks for attempting this question)
c)	In the Monte Carlo simulation, you have to repeat the experiment a certain number of times ‘n’. Plot the value of the probability you have determined in part a for different values of ‘n’ and discuss how the probability changes with increasing the value of ‘n’.
